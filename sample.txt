Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses a previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries to execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from cron.\n\n Several implementations of locate exist: the original implementation from GNU's findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate are:\n\n  * it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only    include files that the user running locate has access to. It does    this by updating the database as root, but making it unreadable for    normal users, who can only access it via the locate binary. slocate    does this as well, but not the original locate.\n\n  * instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time    the database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its    database and can know if the contents of a directory changed without    reading them again. This makes updates much faster and less demanding    on the hard drive. This feature is only found in mlocate.\n\n Installing mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to mlocate via the alternatives mechanism.

It permits anyone to use the simple yet powerful template language to reference objects defined in Java code. When Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers can focus solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers can focus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java code from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over the long run and providing a viable alternative to Java Server Pages (JSPs) or PHP."},"info":{"Package":"info","Dependencies":["libc6","libtinfo5","install-info"],"Reverse dependencies":["ubuntu-standard"],"Unavailable dependencies":[],"Description":" Standalone GNU Info documentation browser\n\n The Info file format is an easily-parsable representation for online documents.
